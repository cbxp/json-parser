# json-parser

Technical exercise for practicing TDD and programming skills

## The exercise
You need to write a JSON parser

### Given
You have given an empty implementation: JsonParser and a bunch of simple tests: JsonParserTest

You can use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K to convert them to Kotlin, if you like.

### Goal
You need to implement JsonParser to support as many [JSON features as possible](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
We recommend to start with the simplest cases: plain number, plain string, array, etc.

## How to run tests
1. In IDEA: "Run configurations" -> "tests"
2. From command line: "./gradlew"

## Process
0. Gather in teams of 2-4 people
1. You create a branch from the `main` branch
2. You commit every small change to this branch
3. You will see results on https://github.com/cbxp/json-parser/actions
4. We will periodically add new tests to the `main` branch
5. After the deadline, you will present your algorithm
